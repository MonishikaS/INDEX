# CHAPTER 1 Getting Started
## What is C?
* Developed AT and I's Bell haboratories
* 1972 by Dennis Ritchie.
* C++, C# 03 Java make use OOP Cobject Oriented Programming)
* Major Operating Systems like Windows, UNIX,Linux and Android are written in C.

## Which I are we Learning ?
*The official description of C Programming lang.was published by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie in 1978.
*ANSIC => American National Standards Institute.Also known as C89

## Types of C Constants
### Primary - 
    Integer, Real, Character
### Secondary- 
     Pointor, Array, String, Structure,Ilwian, Enum.
     
## Rules for Constructing
### 1. Integer Constants.
* Must contain at least 1 digit
* Not contain decemal point
* Values can be O, +ve or -ve
* Commas /blanks are **_NOT_** allowed
* Range = (-2147483648) to (2147483647)

### 2. Real Coustants C. Floating Point Constents)
* They can be written in 2 forms
* 1. Fractional Form
* 2. Exponential Form
* Parts before 'e' = **Mantissa**
* Parts after 'e' = **Exponent**
* M&E should be deparated by e on E
* M have +ve of -ve sign.
* E have +ve of -ve sign.
* Range = (-3.4e38) to (3.4e38)

### 3. Character Constants:-
* It is a single digit, alphabted or Symbol enclosed within **' '**

## C Keywords -
* Pre-defined words.
* Should not be used as variable names 
* Ex:-do
while
void
volatile
const
auto
break
auto
break

## Comments :-
* Can be in small, captical of Combo.
* /* */ or //.
* Can be written anywhere in statement
* Can't be nested.
* Can be split over more than 1 line

## Main ():-
* Is a function
* All statements are enclosed within {}
* Always returns an integer
* Some compiler like Turbo C/C++ even permit us to return nathing from main ().So we use void 

## printf():-
* To use printf() we need to use #include <stdio> which is a proprocess or directive
Ex: printf ("%f", si);
printf ("%d %f",p,n);
printf ("S=%f", si);
printf ("S=%d \n R=%f", s,r);
* Here we used NEWLINE Character (\n)
  
## Editor:-
Lets us type our program
  
## Compiler:-
Converts are program to Machine lang.
* Apart from from these we also need linker, Debugger so we use GUI. The bundle is called IDE(Integrated Development Environment).
  
## Scanf():-
Helps us receive input values.
* Use of (&) Ampersand before variables in scanf()is necessary (&) = Address of operator
* Ex: &a = We are telling scanf() at which memory location should it store value given by user.
