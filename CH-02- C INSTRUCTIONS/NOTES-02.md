# CHAPTER 2 INSTRUCTIONS

## TYPES OF INSTRUCTIONS:-
### 1. Type Declaration Instructions

* Used to declare the types of variables being used in the program.
* Written at beginning of main () function
* Ex:- int i=10, j=95;
* float b=a+3=1; X **{As a is not declared }**
* int a = b = c= d = 10;
[ Here  we are trying to use b before defining]

### 2. Arithmetic Instructions:-
* Used to perform arithmetic operations on constants and variables.
* *,/,-,+
* = Cassignment operator)
* Ex:- int ad ;
* float kot;
* ad=3200; **[Integer Variable]**
* Kot = 0.00560; **[ Real Variable ]**
* Variables + constants = **Operands**

### They are of 3 types.- 
* 1. Integer mode
* 2. Real mode
* 3. Mixed nede

### Instructions to follow:-
* z= K*i [âœ“]
* but k*i=z [X]
* Modular division (90) is also provided [Remainder ]. Ex 8 - 10/2=5, whereas 10%2=0.
* % can't be used with floats.
* Remainder is of same sign as that of Numerator.
* Ex - 5%-2=1
* ASCII of a -z = 97- 122 and A-Z = 65-90
